# Lesson 1. Understanding tokens and ERC20
The contract AlwaysLearningValueToken that defines the ALV tokens is deployed in the **Sepolia Network** in this address:
0x8582c90cbf425c235c8dd04019bdf0472a76f625.

This is the Etherscan link: [Contract Address 0x8582c90cbf425c235c8dd04019bdf0472a76f625 | Etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x8582c90cbf425c235c8dd04019bdf0472a76f625).

## Activities
 1. Use the contract address to activate the ALV in your Metamask wallet.
	 1. Verify that you have received 500 ALV.
 2. Send me 100 ALV.
 3. Send 100 ALV to your second account.
 4. Send me 50 ALV from your second account.
	 1. That shouldn't work. Why?
	 2. Solve the problem.
 5. Using your **first account**, follow the Etherscan code interface to mint 500 ALV.
	 1. Did it mint 500 ALV or a fraction? Why?
	 2. Burn the ALV amount that you have just minted.
	 3. Burn 500 ALV.
 7.  Using your **second** account, try to mint 500 ALV.
	 1. That shouldn't work. Why?
	 2. Send me half of your ALV using the Etherscan contract interface.
	 3. Burn the rest.
